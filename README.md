A comprehensive ensemble of machine learning models for data science competitions.

## Usage Instructions

### Training Models
1. Place your dataset in the repository directory.
2. Update the dataset path in `train_models.py`.
3. Run `train_models.py` to train the models.

### Evaluating Models
1. Ensure the trained models are saved.
2. Update the test data paths in `evaluate_models.py`.
3. Run `evaluate_models.py` to evaluate the models.

### Adding New Models
